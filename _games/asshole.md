Fun game, played with a minimum of 5 people – also the recommended number.
An even number of cards are dealt to each player (if there are extras, set them aside for the turn). The first hand establishes roles.
A hand ends when either every player is forced to pass, or a 2 is played (as explained below). The round ends when all players (or all but 1) are out of cards.

After a player lays a card from their hand, the next player has the option to either play a higher card (shown below) or pass if unable. The first person out of cards is the "President" for the next round, second is the "Vice President", next two are the "Normal People", and the last one is the titular "Asshole". The Asshole wears the "Asshole" Hat for the duration they're in that position.

Card order: 2 is the highest card in the game. Then A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3. A single 2, being the most powerful card in the game, ends the hand and immediately starts a new lead.

Roles:
**President:** Can make any player in the game drink – only has to drink if he so chooses. Starts each hand (privilege of power). The President never has to refill their own drink.
**Vice President:** Can make any player except the President drink. Only has to drink if the President says, or if they so choose. Goes second in a hand.
**Normal People:** Can make each other or the Asshole drink. They play in order they were out of the last hand.
**Asshole:** Truly the Asshole of the group. Anyone can make the Asshole drink. The Asshole shuffles and deals the cards, and picks them up after each hand. The Asshole is responsible for making sure everyone else's drink is filled.

Once per round, the other players, by majority vote, can ask a silly or stupid task of the Asshole (nothing too bad). Things like "Eat this tomato in one bite, Asshole" or "Do 10 pushups, Asshole!"
