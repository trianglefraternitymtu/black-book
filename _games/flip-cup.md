Another favorite. This is an incredibly simple game, but not played very often in our house.
Two teams of an equal number of players stand on opposite sides of a table, facing one another. The players directly facing are opponents. In front of each teammate is a cup filled with a set amount of beer. Wop, wine, or another drink could be used if the players so choose.

After counting down (in the interest of a fair start), the first member of each team slams their cup. Once finished, the cup is placed open-side down on the edge of the table, and the player attempts to flip the cup, by flicking or lifting the bottom, until it flips and lands face down on the table, sitting on its mouth. (360-degree rotation) The player may not use two hands, or blow on the cup to guide the cup to flip over. If the player is unsuccessful on the first try, the cup is reset and re-flipped.

Only after the first teammate is done flipping successfully can the next person proceed. Additionally, subsequent players may not touch or manipulate their cup until the previous player has successfully flipped their cup. Whichever team finishes drinking and flipping all its cups first wins.
If the group so chooses, the group can play a down-and-back method, with each player responsible for two cups.
