All players sit in a circle or around a table. Each player counts off, one, two, three, etc. until you reach 21. Once you reach 21 that player gets to make a new rule to be added into the game. The only rule in the game to start is players cannot say 7 or anything with 7 in it or that is a multiple (7,14,17,21) instead they remain silent and tap the table. If someone messes up the whole table drinks one and the one who messed up drinks two. New person starts again.

Example rules:
- There and back again (a hobbit's tale): go back down to 1 after reaching 21 to win
- Reverse! Reverse!: at reaching a specific number the direction of play is reversed
- Spin Move: at reaching a number the player must get up and spin
- Skip: after saying a number that player is skipped next time round
- The Price of Success: the player who “wins” must drink a cup put in the middle
- Edit: replace a number with a phrase or sound
- Delete: remove a number from play
- Inside Joke: rules cannot be taught you must learn by playing
- Mute: all numbers must be conveyed by hand sign or nonverbal means
- Think of the children!: No swearing
- etc etc etc etc
