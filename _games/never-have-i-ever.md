Doesn't need an introduction. You probably played this in middle school, if not at college.
Players take turns saying things they've never done – ever. If you've done what's stated, you either drink or put down a finger – as explained below.

### Variation 1:
Rather than putting up a set number of fingers, players merely drink. Game goes on until players get tired.

### Variation 2:
Players put up a number of fingers – 5 or 10, normally. Players put down a finger at the appropriate time, until someone runs out. At this point, they take the shot and put up their fingers again. Repeat ad nauseam (literally, maybe)
