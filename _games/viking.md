The players sit in a circle, one person goes first. The player makes "wiggly viking horns," simply thumbs in, or near, ears and wiggles the remaining fingers for a second or two, then claps both palms together, and points them at any other player.

This player then does the "viking horns," but the player on each side of the "viking" must "steer the boat." This entails rowing to whatever side of the Viking the player is sitting on; right of the Viking rows right, left rows the boat left. The Viking then claps both palms together and designates another Viking.

This continues until either the designated Viking misses his/her cue, or either rower fails to row the boat in the appropriate direction; whomever fails drinks, and then that person resumes play with "the horns."
