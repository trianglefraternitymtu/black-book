A true classic. Arguably, the best-known drinking game played with dice.
To begin, players take turns rolling a die. The first one to roll a 3 is the "Three Man". If you're playing with the "Asshole" Hat, the Three Man then puts on said hat.
The player to the left of the Three Man begins, rolling both dice. The results of the dice combinations are listed below.
If the Three Man, on their turn, rolls a three (in sum or on a die), they are no longer the Three Man. At this point, they can designate any player the Three Man and the game continues.

Dice Rolls | Actions
:---|---
Total of 7 | Player to right of roller drinks
Total of 9 | Social
Total of 11 | Player to left of roller drinks
Any 3 or sum to 3 | Three Man drinks
1 and 4 | Thumb on floor
1 and 5 | Finger on nose
Doubles | Give 'em away


Dice rolls stack. This means that rolling (3:4) invokes both the *Three Man* rule and the *Total of 7* Rule.
