A fast-paced game like [Thumper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _games/thumper.md %}) or [Zoomie Zoomie]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _games/zoomie-zoomie.md %}), played with cards. If you've played Egyptian Rat Screw, you can play this.

Best played with a large number of people (for obvious reasons).
One person is designated as the dealer. (This person should be changed every round because the dealer is at a distinct disadvantage. Some people play that the dealer does not play on his/her turn.)
The dealer begins by placing cards, face up, in a stack, and calls out the number on each turn. When two cards of the same number come up in a row, the first person to bring his/her hand down onto the top of the pile gets the top card, and is then allowed to "give out" the number of the card in drinks to whomever he/she wishes.
Rounds end when the dealer runs out of cards.

Face cards are worth 10 drinks, Aces are 1.
