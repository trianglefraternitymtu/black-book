You and the other player sit across from each other – feet to feet – and have small drinking glasses between your legs. You fill the glass about halfway with your beverage of choice, and play proceeds.
Players take turns shooting bottle caps at the other player's glass – if the shot is good, the other player has the chance to shoot a rebuttal.
If they are unsuccessful, they must finish what's in their glass. If the rebuttal is good, both players “Cheers” and finish their glasses together. Rinse and repeat.

If playing with a bunch of people, the pairs should line up side-by-side. This gives the opportunity for a player to shoot at a glass farther down the line. Should he make it, everyone down the line from the glass he made to his partner has a chance to shoot a rebuttal – and they all drink.
