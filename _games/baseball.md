# Setup
The cups are arranged in a line centered with the table. The first cup is flush with the edge of the table, followed by a gap one cup wide, and the remaining three cups in a "stoplight" shape lip-to-lip. When setup is complete, you proceed with singing the national anthems of the nations that are represented.

# Gameplay
Players take turn "at-bat” (throwing a ping-pong ball at the cups), with innings like a real game of baseball. The nearest cup is a single, middle is a double, far cup (of the group of three) is a triple, and the back cup is a grand-slam home run.
- Players strike if they hit the table without touching a cup. Three strikes is an out.
- If the player's throw hits a cup and bounces off, they get the ball back and continue throwing. Consider this a "foul" – it counts towards strikes, but a player cannot strike out in this manner.
- If a defending player catches a "foul" using ONLY one hand (cannot brace against their body/another player) then the at-bat player is out.


Optional: Stealing Bases
If there's enough beer, two additional cups may be set up at the midpoints of the sides of the table. These are filled one-third of the way with beer. When a "running" player is on the first or third base, a defending player may take up position opposite them. At any time, the running player may slam their cup, and attempt a one-round game of Flip Cup.
- If the running player successfully completes a 360-degree flip of their cup first, they stole a base and moves forward.
- If the defending player successfully completes their flip first, the running player is out.
