When it comes to drinking card games, this is the gold standard. Best played with a large group. Rules for the cards are listed below, but some groups play differently.

The cards are either spread in a loose pile in the center of the table, or arranged in a circle around a filled shot glass/full can of beer.
On each player's turn, they draw one card and take the corresponding action.
With shot: If a player breaks the circle of cards, they take the shot.
With can of beer: After taking the action for the card, the player slides it under the tab. If they break the seal on the can, they have to drink it

Card Actions:

Card | Action | Description
:---|:---:|:---
2 | You | Give a drink.
3 | Me | Take a drink.
4 | Whores | Women drink. Sorry.
5 | Drive | Player
6 | Dicks | Men drink.
7 | Heaven | Last person with arms up drinks.
8 | Mate/Date | Choose someone. Any time you drink, they drink. The reverse is optional, and is up to the group to decide.
9 | Rhyme | Person who drew the card says a word Players go around the circle saying words that rhyme with it. First one to not come up with something that rhymes has to drink.
10 | Categories | Player names a category (e.g. college football teams) and players go around the circle naming things in that category. First one to not come up with something that fits the category has to drink.
Jack | Thumb Master | Player can, at anytime, place their thumb on the table. The last player to put their thumb on the table drinks.
Queen | Question Master | Player man ask a question at any time. If anyone responds in any manner other than with a question, they must drink.
King | Make a rule | Player makes a rule that persists until the end of the game. The ability to remove previous rules is optional, and is up to the group to decide.
Ace | Waterfall | Player begins drinking. Players follow suit around the circle, and cannot stop until the previous player does.

*Optional rule for Aces*: The person drawing the ace decides which direction the waterfall goes around the circle by asking a general knowledge question (that anyone sitting at the table SHOULD know) to the two people next to him/her. The person who answers the question correctly first gets the waterfall started in their direction, and the loser thus has to drink longest.
