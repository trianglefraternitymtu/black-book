# Setup
Line the cups up and agree upon an order – they should be numbered 1-6.
Write on them in Sharpie if that makes it easier.

# Gameplay
Take turns rolling the die – doesn't matter if you go clockwise or counter-clockwise.
The numbers on the die correspond with the cup. If the cup whose number you roll is empty, pour in as much beer as you want (or dare).
If the cup is not empty, you have to slam it. This is where the betting component of the game comes into play – it's entirely possible to have to drink a cup you poured yourself.
