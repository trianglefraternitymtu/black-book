The lead player sounds roll call ("Zoomie Zoomie Roll Call!") and  names off as "Zoomie", follow sequentially by "One", "Two", and so forth. The Zoomie begins pounding a rhythm on the table. Other players follow suit. To begin play, all players together repeat "Zoomie Zoomay, Zoomie Zoomie" twice, and the Zoomie starts.

Similar to [Viking]({% link _games/viking.md %}), the turn is passed from player to player starting with the Zoomie. To pass the turn, you say (in line with the beat) your number twice, and the number of the target player. The Zoomie, of course, uses their moniker rather than a number.
For example: If the Zoomie starts the game by passing the turn to player Two.; "Zoomie Zoomie Two Two".
Player Two then decides to pass it to player One – "Two Two One One" – and the game continues.

The pace increases until, like Thumper, when someone doesn't respond or takes too long to respond. At this point, the other players chant "You SUCK, you SUCK, you SUCK you SUCK you SUCK, drink BITCH!"

NB: This game is best explained in person by someone who has played it before.
