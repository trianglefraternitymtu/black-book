It's very simple to set up and learn, and is fast-paced. The rules below are as-written by the creators of the game – [pinkymcdrinky.com](http://pinkymcdrinky.com/)'s Neil & Clint. Small formatting changes have been made, and the "Devil's Number" rule is added, as it wasn't clear in the original rules.
The game begins with one player rolling the pink die (aka "pinky").
After the initial roll, both players roll their white dice simultaneously.

Basic Play:
- If the sum of the two white dice is 7, both players take a single drink (social).
- If the players roll the same quantity on their dice, they paper-rock-scissors. The loser takes one drink.
- If one of the players matches the pink die, the other player drinks that amount.
- Once the number on the pink die is matched, the player that matched it re-rolls the pink die.

Exceptions:
- Triples: If all three dice match, both players must immediately grab for the pink die. The person that is able to grab 'pinky' first gets to roll him. The unfortunate opponent must then drink twice that amount.
- The Devil's Number: A subset of the "Triples" rule. If both players roll a 6 to match the pink die (666), the player that loses the die grab has to take a shot – as opposed to drinking twice the number on the die.
- Sloppy Roller Rule: If at any point the die falls off the table, the roller takes a drink and must re-roll.
