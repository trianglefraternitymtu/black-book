# Setup
1. Remove all the 7's from the deck of cards, and reshuffle the deck.
2. Line the 7's in a link, length-wise across your playing area.
3. Deal the rest of the deck out to everyone who is playing.

# Gameplay
- Person left of the dealer starts.
- Each player *must* lay down 1 card in line with the 7's, matching the suit to the 7's suit. Aces can either be high or low, whomever lays it down first gets to decide.
  - If there is a gap between that card and the 7, then the player drinks the difference.
  - If there is no gap between that card and the 7, then the player gives the number of drinks equal to the number of cards that are connected to that 7.
- Repeat
