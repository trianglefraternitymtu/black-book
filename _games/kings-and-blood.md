Super simple betting game, similar to the dice game [Sixes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _games/sixes.md %}).

Shuffle the deck of cards, place them face down on the table. Place the cup in the center (clear a space if need be). Players take turns drawing cards.

Card | Action
:---|---
Black cards *(except Kings)* | Freebies â€“ nothing happens.
Red cards | Drink twice.
**ANY** King | Pour as much of your beverage in the center cup.

Whomever draws the last king must slam the contents of the cup. Rinse and repeat.

This gets really gross, really fast if people aren't all drinking beer.
