Play is simple and fast-paced... provided players are capable of hitting a can of beer from across a table.
Two teams are formed and play on opposite sides of the table
Both teams place an unopened beer can in front of them.
Teams alternate 1-for-1 throwing the ping-pong ball at their opponents' beer cans.
If the thrower hits one of the opponents' cans, the thrower can chug their beer until the opponents retrieve the ball and yell "STOP!" as soon as they place the ball over the can which was hit.
If the ball is caught one-handed by the defending team prior to the ball hitting the ground, the thrower must immediately stop drinking.
Penalty sips are awarded for illegal drinking as a result from an illegal catch or stoppage of play.
When a player has finished their beer they are out of the game â€“ at this point, they become an observer.
The team with all their beers finished wins.
