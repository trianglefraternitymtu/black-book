24 cups are set up in the middle of a table (it's recommended that a tarp be placed below the table, as beer if often spilled). 23 of these cups are filled one-third of the way with beer, and the final cup (in the middle) is filled all the way.
Players take turns trying to bounce a ping-pong ball into an empty cup immediately in front of them.
- First shots are determined by random selection
- Each new game should rotate who takes the first shot along with a random rotation of the players around the table.
- First rule of Slap Cup is there should always be 2 empty cups on the table.
- The first 2 shooters "Touch Balls" then grab a cup, drink the contents, and bounce their ball off the table and try to get into the empty cup that they just drank.
- If they get the shot in the cup on the first try they pass their cup with the ball in it to anyone around the table.
- If they get it in on the second shot or any shot after that they can only pass the cup to their immediate left.
- If the person to the immediate left of the person shooting is trying to get their ball in but hasn't yet they should get their cup slapped (only by the person that just hit their shot).
- If the empty cup in front of a person is slapped away, they grab a cup from the middle, drink the contents, and continue play with the now-empty cup in front of them.
- Play continues until the only cup left is the full cup in the middle. The last player to have their cup slapped away is then the loser, and must slam the full cup of beer.

## Stack Up Variation
The direction of play is usually counter clockwise, so cups are passed to your right
Instead of slapping away a cup, you instead stack your cup on top of their cup (or tower of cups, as quickly becomes the case). That person passes the ever increasing tower of cups to their right, and must now grab a new cup and continue play as normal.
