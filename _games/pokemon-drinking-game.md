# Board Creation

Select one of the boards below and print it off using a poster printer, but for best results, shoot for a 3 foot plotter. After paying money to get this huge board printed, you should attach it to it to a large piece of poster board or other presentation styrofoam sheet, found in most office supply stores, using spray-on glue or glue sticks. Lastly, cover the entire board, including the back, with clear tape to protect it from spilled drinks. To get the most out of your board, print 2 different copies and put then on either side of the board. So you could have [Gen 1]({{ "/assets/img/gen1_pokemon.png" | relative_url }}) on one side, and [Gen 2]({{ "/assets/img/gen2_pokemon.png" | relative_url }}) on the back so that THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES.

- [Gen 1 Pokemon]({{ "/assets/img/gen1_pokemon.png" | relative_url }})
- [Gen 2 Pokemon]({{ "/assets/img/gen2_pokemon.png" | relative_url }})
- [Gen 3 Pokemon]({{ "/assets/img/gen3_pokemon.jpg" | relative_url }})
- [Gen 3 Pokemon (no boarder)]({{ "/assets/img/gen3_pokemon-no_border.png" | relative_url }})

# Setup

- Make the board
- Each player should put their game piece on the starting position.
- Each player should select a starting Pokemon, refer to the board you printed for the available options.
- Attempt to read the rules off the board out loud so the others can heard them, and give up halfway through because they're being too loud. ~~Drunk assholes...~~

# Gameplay

1. Roll the die.
  - If it falls off the table, take 2 for sucking and try again...
2. Move forward that many of spots, **but not past a gym. You must stop at the gyms**
3. Read off the square that you just stopped at, and do what ever it says.
  - If you land on a spot, that isn't a gym, and it is occupied by another player. You too have to do a "Pokemon Battle", where each player rolls a die and the one with the lower die drinks. If one of the players has a starter Pokemon who's type has advantage over the over the other player's Pokemon, then that player gets to roll 2 die instead.
