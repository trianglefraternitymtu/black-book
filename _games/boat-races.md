Flip Cup without the skill component. Well, it does include whatever amount of skill slamming a cup of booze entails.
Players line up in two teams along the table with a cup in front of them.
Players are not allowed to touch their cup until the previous player has finished.

The first pair of players (upon counting down) pick up their cups and slam them. The moment the cups touch the table, the next pair can pick up their cups, and so on.
If there's a tie, you can have a one-on-one challenge â€“ but we recommend another game to determine the winner. What's the harm?

This can also be played in a down-and-back manner with each player having two cups in front of them.
