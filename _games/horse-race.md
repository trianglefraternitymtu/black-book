This game does a good job of gathering people together to play a series of games in a row. A horse race is pretty straight forward and gets people excited to play more games.

# Setup
1. Remove all the Aces from the deck of cards, and reshuffle the deck.
2. Line the horses *(aka the Aces)* up at the "starting line".
3. Line up good portion of the rest of the cards, face down, in a line down the length of your table, or "track".
  - A track of 8-10 cards long is a pretty good length.
  - You can have places to "re-bet" by turning those card sideways to the rest of the cards.
4. Gather initial bets. Make sure to loud and talk fast to try and gather people together to play.

# Gameplay
The dealer will flip a card over from the remainder of the deck, they will then move the horse of that suit down the track by 1 spot. If the card on the track is face down when the horse gets there, then flip it over and move the horse of that suit down the track by 1 spot as well. Stop game play whenever you flip up a sideways "re-bit" spot, and take on more bets. The first horse to run past the end of the track, wins and issue out the "winnings" accordingly.

# Betting
Generally, bets will give you a 2-to-1 return, but you have to pay up front. Meaning, that if you want to "bet 5 drinks on spades", then you must drink 5 first. In this case, if spades wins, then that person gets to give out **10** drinks. As the dealer, you can choose to select a different return rate, like 3-to-1 or ever 4-to-1, but 2-to-1 is a pretty good medium between order and chaos.
