The classic – needs no introduction.
In its simplest form, Beer Pong consists of a game where two teams of two players take turns throwing a ping-pong ball into a cup. These cups are arranged in a 1-2-3-4 triangle of 10 cups (to start) in front of the teams, centered on the table with the back side of the cups flush against the edge of the table. Every group plays a little differently, and below are listed our House Rules.

1. Don't be a bitch.
2. 2 Re-racks per game.  Optional rule: Allowed re-racks are on 6 cups and 3 cups remaining ONLY, and ONLY into triangles.
3. Ball bounce into cup → 2 cups removed
4. PG-13 (No fingering/blowing)
5. Island once per person, per game (2 cups removed)
6. Balls back if you both make a cup
7. 3 cups and balls back if you make the same cup
8. Trick shots are worth 2 cups
9. Rollbacks are a Gentleman's Shot (behind the back)
10. NBA Jam (2 cups – heating up; 3 cups – on fire, shoot until you miss)
11. Rebuttal allowed – overtime is 3 cups
