Deal the cards out to the group evenly. One player begins the game by laying a card from their hand and saying "Fuck you, [name]", directed at another player.
That player then must lay down the same card (number, not suit) and redirect it to another player. Alternatively, another player may save the victim and redirect it elsewhere. You do not have to redirect the drink if you don't want to.
The person who is "fucked" then gets to play a card. Repeat until everyone is out of cards.

Note: When you are out of cards, you can still be "fucked." It is up to other players to save you.
Thus, it is not always a good idea to spend all your cards early defending yourself.

It is a good strategy to keep track of cards and know when you have the last card left. Early in the game it is also fairly safe to play cards you have more of (doubles, triples).

Here are the card values:

Card | Action
:---|---
Ace through 5 | Pass out the card value
6 through 10 | Pass out 1/2 the card value
Face cards | Pass out 5 drinks
