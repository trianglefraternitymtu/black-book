The cups are set up in a 10x10 grid and 83 are filled one-third of the way with beer. The remaining 17 are filled with the liquor mixed drink (equating to about 1 shot per cup). These 17 cups are arranged in the traditional 5-4-3-3-2 groups, as in the board game Battleship.
The goal of the game is to sink the opposing team's battleships, by taking turns throwing ping-pong balls, as in Beer Pong. When a cup containing beer is made (i.e. a "miss"), a member of the receiving team drinks the beer and removes the cup from play. When a cup containing liquor is made (i.e. a hit), the receiving team must drink the shot, and then place the cup back on the table in its original place, but upside down, to signify the location of the hit. The game ends when one team's entire fleet is sunk. The losing team is then responsible for finishing the remaining cups on the table. If this is an unreasonable number of cups, they can recruit volunteers from observers and the winning team.
Cups are automatically re-racked into squares when an appropriate number is reached: 64, 36, and 25; into triangles at 15, 10, 6, and 3.
