  - Special Jenga Set
  - Beer or drink of choice

The Jenga tower is set up normally, and play proceeds. There are a few general rules, as well as the block-specific rules (numbered). There are 18 rules, so each rule gets printed on 3 blocks, for the total of 54 in the set.
- The person who knocks down the tower must finish their entire drink
- You may not touch the tower at any time if it is not your turn
- You may not touch the player whose turn it is during their turn
- If the tower falls because you shook or bumped the table, you must finish all the drinks on the table
- If you are sitting at the table, you are playing the game.
- If you are standing and watching the game, you must drink when the block instructs (you may also be “given” drinks)
