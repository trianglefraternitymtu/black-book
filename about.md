# About the Black Book

For a number of years now, there has existed a "Black Book" full of party games behind our bar. This book was first made as a Google Drive Document and shared with people who didn't have a physical copy of the book, but they also could print their own from there. As time went on, this method of sharing content seemed rather clunky and inefficient, so a new version of the book was created. This website is to facilitate this new method of sharing the fun times and party games that can be played at any party, and in a format that can be found at your fingertips.

Contributions to this website are greatly appreciated and can be done from GitHub. Just fork the [repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}), add your changes, and create a pull request to have them added back into this website.
